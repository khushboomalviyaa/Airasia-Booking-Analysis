Objective:
The project aims to analyze air travel data to uncover trends in passenger behavior, flight characteristics, and travel decisions. The goal is to provide insights that help optimize airline operations, improve customer service, and enhance the overall travel experience.

Description:
This project uses a dataset containing information about flights, routes, trip types, and passenger preferences (e.g., baggage, seat choices). Key analysis steps include:

Data Cleaning and Exploration:
We clean the dataset, explore relationships between features, and perform basic descriptive analysis to understand trends in booking patterns, flight duration, baggage inclusion, and seat categories.

Visualizations:
Various visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, and scatter plots) are used to answer questions such as:

How do purchase lead times vary by flight day?
What are the most common seat categories?
How does baggage inclusion differ by route?
Insights:
The analysis reveals patterns like the relationship between flight duration and booking lead times, differences in passenger behavior on weekdays vs. weekends, and baggage preferences based on routes.

Conclusion:
The project provides actionable insights for improving airline operations, such as optimizing pricing strategies based on booking lead times and tailoring services like baggage and seat options to customer preferences.
